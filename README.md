This repository contains a batch script that allows users to easily change the system date on their computer. The script enables users to travel back in time to the year 2015 or return to the current date and time.

The main purpose of this script is to facilitate running older programs or applications that are incompatible with modern operating systems due to specific date requirements. By temporarily adjusting the system date, users can create an environment that emulates a past time period, allowing them to use legacy software without encountering compatibility issues.

The script provides a simple user interface with two options:

1. Travel in Time to 2015: Selecting this option will change the system date to January 1, 2015. This option is useful for running programs that require a specific date from the past.

2. Come Back From the Time Travel: Choosing this option will bring the system back to the current date and time. It utilizes the "w32tm" command to resynchronize the system clock with the network time server, ensuring accurate timekeeping after returning from the time travel.

The script includes error handling for invalid input, displaying a message if an unrecognized option is selected.

Feel free to use, modify, and distribute this script according to your needs. It provides a convenient solution for dealing with compatibility challenges when working with older software on modern operating systems.
